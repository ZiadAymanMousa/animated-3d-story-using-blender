# animated-3d-story-using-blender
in this project i designed and created many models including a full human body and wooden cabin as a home and many other models including a big forest .
In this 3D animated story, the viewer is taken on a journey through a beautiful forest, filled with lush trees, vibrant foliage, and a diverse range of wildlife. The centerpiece of the forest is an old cabin home, which has been lovingly crafted and designed with intricate detail.

As the story progresses, we are introduced to a human hunter model, who is the protagonist of the tale. The hunter is equipped with a range of accessories, also fully designed by me , All of the models in the scene have been meticulously crafted, with a keen eye for detail and realism.

To bring the scene to life, I used high-quality textures and lighting, which work together to create a truly immersive environment. Finally, the entire scene has been rendered to create a stunning 1080p 30 fps video, which showcases the incredible detail and craftsmanship that has gone into this project.
